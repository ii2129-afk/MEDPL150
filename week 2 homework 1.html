<p>With this picture, I wanted to capture the liveliness I noticed around the college. It doesn't seem to just be students constantly around the area; there are people living nearby, too, which makes sense given the number of apartments close by. The subway station is where all those people converge, and I found this one near the North Building entrance with my group. With that in mind, I waited for people to walk by in the picture to capture them, though I wanted to take the picture as strangers passed by. Nobody is directly facing the camera, which was the intention. There's just a sort of busy quality to this street corner that drew me in. In regards to the editing, I opted to use brighter colors to accentuate the energy of the image. I used a gradient of pink to blue in order to overlay it on the image, as one would consider those colors as pretty opposite to one another, though a gradient connecting them has an eye-catching feeling to it. The idea of two bright colors, with all the ones in the middle, getting the viewer's attention, was what I was going for. The editing just makes the entire image pop more, though there's still a bit of focus on the station entrance, as well as the people passing by it. </p>
