<h1>Homework 4 - 1st image</h1>

<h2>1st Image</h2>

  <p>To be blunt, I'm rather proud of the first image, and disappointed with the second one. The main issue I find is that the first image captured my vision of what I wanted perfectly, and the second image was very subpar to me in comparison. Another comparison is that the first image feels very cohesive and straightforward, while the second is very messy both in its colors and what it's trying to actually convey. I was hoping to fix the second image with the addition of extra touch-ups and adding the text, but ironically an issue I find with the first image is that the image works well enough on its own that I was not very sure how to add text to it later. However, it's at least easier. The pixelation is on purpose, but was not originally planned; GitHub is a nightmare, and for some reason, this image was the only one that would not properly keep the image's scale. I changed the image's scale in Photoshop to a smaller scale that still kept the 5 by 7 ratio and uploaded it to GitHub, and then and only then did it work. The pixelated look goes with it visually, though; I think that I like the simplicity of the image paired with the image being "simpler" (in pixel count) as a whole. If I had extra time and motivation for this assignment, I would consider redoing the second image entirely, and adding onto the first image; I may sound overly critical, but I am not proud of the first image.</p>
