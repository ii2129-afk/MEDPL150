<p>The original unedited photo for this one, I feel, is the weaker of the two I took; however, I tried to not let it deter me, and instead used the points I thought were weak to be enhanced by the editing. For instance, I noticed that the photo wasn't really centered right. That was fixed with the quick crop, hence why I opted to make this image the 5 in by 7 in one. I had also noticed that the image was a bit dark, both because of the lighting of this auditorium and because I may not have adjusted my camera settings to account for it. Instead of fussing over making it brighter, I capitalized on the lack of lighting, and decided to give this image a more eerie feel with my tonal adjustments. I used a gradient map, though I also made some changes to it afterwards using curves. The curtains are red and the image itself feels rather warm, so I made it a little cooler visually in order to add that kind of dissonance I was aiming for. Then, I tweaked the brightness and contrast to not obscure too many details,  but to still give a strange look to the picture. It was also how I got the more greenish color that appears more as the image goes lower; adjusting the curves for specifically the green color, then using contrast to make it stand out more, did the trick. I feel like this was a case of using editing to salvage what otherwise would not have been an adequate picture, and I'm a little proud of myself for it. The works I'm most proud of tend to be those that I simply have to make the most of with what I have.</p>
