  <p>This is honestly one of the assignments I have struggled with the most, as I felt like I couldn't make it as good quality as I wanted. I was unsure at first about the three color limit, and wanted to stay on the safe side and make it literally *just* three colors. Because of that, I also had to do some planning to figure out what each part would be in color, so as to not overpower the image with any one of them, or make it harder to read. The blob brush tool was honestly my savior here, since it allowed me to fill in parts of shapes easily without messing too much with the actual points until later. Making the shapes was easier for parts like the bed and walls, though I had issues where making shapes would result in points being closer to each other and I'd accidentally alter an already-okay shape. I had a kind of quick and messy solution to this, making use of the arranging... The shapes aren't completely accurate for that reason since some may be larger, BUT that is not visible in the final image, because of how I arranged the shapes. I feel like I handled this assignment very simply, and so I wish Illustrator was just easier to work with so I could feel more comfortable in making all those shapes. When drawing them out, or moving points around, Illustrator would somehow merge them with other shapes, or change them entirely, and it was a frustrating experience.</p>
