  <p>Compared to the last assignment, I had a lot of fun with this one. The eye felt like the more difficult animation of the two, since I struggled in making the actual shapes in Illustrator. The Photoshop part, putting it together and seeing if it would look good, was much more straightforward. In fact, these recent assignments have revealed to me that Photoshop, as a program, feels much more straightforward and simple than Illustrator does. This is also proven to me by the puppet warp gif I made. I decided to bend the rules a bit by stretching out the image exaggeratedly on purpose, so I used a borzoi, since I found that they had long snouts. My vision was making this a simple gif with no background, so that it could be used as something like a sticker if I'd ever like to personally use it again. I love how it turned out, and I even made use of other tools within Photoshop like liquefy to create effects such as the borzoi blinking cartoonishly. This might have been my favorite assignment of the semester.</p>
