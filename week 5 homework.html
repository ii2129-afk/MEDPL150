<p>Thankfully, I fixed one of the major issues I had with the second image I made, that being the discordant feeling of it. Maybe I could have originally made that work, but it would have been difficult to pull that off well, so I played it safe this time and adjusted the colors to be more harmonious; it worked in my favor, and I'm more satisfied with the result. With the first image, I think I still like the simplicity of it, and I only wish I had made the additions to the text more obvious in what they are (drops, to fit the background being of a lake.) I found the background image and used it because of the deep water sign; with the text, it makes it clearer that this is about mental health. That's also what I wanted to go for with my second image, and I focused on the same theme for both because mental health and illness awareness is incredibly important to me, and it IS a social issue; a lot of people don't seem to be aware of it, but it really does impact so many parts of one's life. Circumstances beyond one's control can influence how their mental health turns out, and that, in turn, can affect them socially, financially, and physically. It's so deeply connected to living, and I want to bring it up in the form of messages pointing out things related to it. I think I only partially got that across, though.</p>
