<p>I found that it was easiest to show the differences in depth of field by taking pictures where there is an object that clearly separates the foreground from the background. I also had to find a place that was large enough to show the depth of field, too. With that, I chose the 8th floor of the North building to do this assignment. The dim lighting of the floor made it a little hard to capture the depth of field well, which might have left the pictures a little underexposed; I made sure to adjust it using camera raw, in addition to straightening the images slightly. Something that bothers me and that I should note for the future is that there's a slight difference in temperature in the images, which remained even after adjustment. I wonder whether it's because of the aperture and how well the camera picking up the light with it would affect the actual visual temperature of the light.</p>
