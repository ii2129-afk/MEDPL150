<p>I found that it was easiest to show the differences in depth of field by taking pictures where there is an object that clearly separates the foreground from the background. I also had to find a place that was large enough to show the depth of field, too. With that, I chose the 8th floor of the North building to do this assignment. The dim lighting of the floor made it a little hard to capture the depth of field well, which might have left the pictures a little underexposed; I made sure to adjust it using camera raw, in addition to straightening the images slightly. Something that bothers me and that I should note for the future is that there's a slight difference in temperature in the images, which remained even after adjustment. I wonder whether it's because of the aperture and how well the camera picking up the light with it would affect the actual visual temperature of the light. If I had to make another actual change, not just in editing but also how I actually took the pictures, I would probably move the camera so that the object is not so centered. It is still somewhat to the side, but I feel like if I could have shown the background more clearly in order to make the differences in depth of field more obvious, I would. I had to make my edits (in things like exposure) subtle, since while the visual light temperature differences bother me, the actual exposure of the images was generally fine, and I did not have to change it greatly without making it over- or underexposed. I also think the lens blur effect looks like, and I can see how I might favor that over the natural blur of objects in some cases (the circular look is pretty visually interesting.)</p>
