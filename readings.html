<h2>Week 2</h2>

<p>After reading Sontag’s writing, quite frankly, I feel as though the description of photography as a means to immortalize a moment resonates with me the most clearly. That is primarily what it has been for me my entire life; for one, I’m well aware I struggle with memory, and that it’s difficult for me to recall even major events unless something triggers those memories to resurface. With photos, I can keep those moments as those “triggers,” and be able to look back on everything I’ve done. Something I’ve liked to do for a few years now is to take a selfie on days where I feel like I look nice. It’s helped me see myself age and heal, especially since I suffer from dealing with poor impulses that hurt me physically (such as picking nails, for example.) The growth and passage of time seems to ground me, almost. In that way, I acknowledge that I’m also using photography to lay bare the truth. The truth of myself, at least.
Looking at others’ photos of anything, the mundane or celebrations or terrifying things that have to be confronted, elicits a very clear emotional response from me, as well. It sounds rather redundant to say, but it also takes some time for certain forms of media (music, for instance) to properly affect me emotionally; photography is one of the forms that immediately gets to me. The reason, I think, would be the clarity of it. Oftentimes the subject or idea of the photo is right there. If not, then that itself is part of the idea. That straightforwardness gives it a unique quality to me, and while I don’t think other kinds of art lack it, to photography it is vital. It tells you, “Look at this, see these things that are right here with you in the world you live in.” Whether the camera captures a flower or tourist spot or person or fight, these things all coexist with the viewer.
Even when one dominant idea isn’t immediately obvious in the photo, that too tells the viewer that it was a deliberate choice from the photographer. It is easy to take pictures. It takes so much more time and skill to perfect those pictures. This is what I’ve learned, both from casually snapping photos on my phone and attempting a photography class. With the latter, I will say clearly that I struggled. On one major project, I got an F, being so caught up with what the teacher kept demanding over and over that I missed what I wanted to do in the first place. I essentially “gave up” on the final project for it, and took pictures of things within my own home, playing with things like lighting to simply see how personally interesting I could make these scenes. I set up fake bushes and a Godzilla figure to make my guinea pig seem huge in comparison. I dimmed the lights and set up a warm lamp to mimic the sunset as one of my dolls lay in bed. I found a book I had wanted to read and set it up on a table along with a mug I made when I was little. As it turns out, this final project salvaged my grade, and I passed the class very comfortably. To me, photography is more of what I make than of what I take.

<h2>Week 4</h2>

<p>AI slop has been one of the most worrying “advancements” in tech I have seen yet. I’ve seen it compared to the NFT craze, though the bubble for that popped rather quickly, and it was more like a fad in hindsight; AI has been latched onto by just about everybody. It’s harrowing to me. It is now baked into whatever smart tech one uses, there are people who will blindly believe it (and even give you the “yes, but things are so weird it could happen anyway” excuse when its false nature is pointed out, as I have experienced often), and it constantly gets closer and closer to mimicking human life and art, yet something is still off. Always. The skin is too smooth; the hair blends into some sort of strange mush; a strange, almost cloudy filter stains the picture. It should be noted that this is GENERATIVE AI. Not all AI is the same, and energy could be much better spent investing into the AI that assists in things like detecting cancer early than the AI that takes away critical thought and selfhood. With it taking away that ability to think for oneself, it inherently ensnares audiences who struggle in it more (think toddlers and the elderly, for instance), feeding them a mass of nothing that isn’t rooted in the world they live in. To make art is a human effort, and to tell a machine to do it for you isn’t “the art of writing prompts,” as generative AI’s supporters insist. It’s taking away what agency you have to speak for yourself. 
It’s especially horrifying to see how much it pervades daily life. Like mentioned before, it has slowly seeped in everywhere. My phone offers its AI for me to ask questions to. Google pushes it at the very top of its page searches. Social media sites constantly push it, practically begging me to say one thing to its robot. I can’t even begin to imagine the weight of how it would affect someone it’s trapped. There are so many horror stories of “chatbot psychosis” I’ve seen, catalyzed by an AI chatbot that does nothing but agree, agree, agree, with no personality, no humanity of its own, only what it’s trained on. It’s notably different to previous advancements in tech that caused scares. TV, video games, and the Internet have all sparked worry about melting children’s minds, being awful influences. The key difference is that at the heart of these, unlike AI, there is still humanity there. Other humans make the shows and games people interact with, and go on the internet to talk to each other. AI creates a truly isolating effect in comparison. This is not to say the other three are all without flaws, though at least they have the freedom of simply different thoughts and experiences. AI is ever-agreeing. It does not think for itself. It has no lived experiences of a person to go off of, to feel with and not calculate.</p>
