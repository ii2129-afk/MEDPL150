<h2>Week 2</h2>

<p>After reading Sontag’s writing, quite frankly, I feel as though the description of photography as a means to immortalize a moment resonates with me the most clearly. That is primarily what it has been for me my entire life; for one, I’m well aware I struggle with memory, and that it’s difficult for me to recall even major events unless something triggers those memories to resurface. With photos, I can keep those moments as those “triggers,” and be able to look back on everything I’ve done. Something I’ve liked to do for a few years now is to take a selfie on days where I feel like I look nice. It’s helped me see myself age and heal, especially since I suffer from dealing with poor impulses that hurt me physically (such as picking nails, for example.) The growth and passage of time seems to ground me, almost. In that way, I acknowledge that I’m also using photography to lay bare the truth. The truth of myself, at least.
Looking at others’ photos of anything, the mundane or celebrations or terrifying things that have to be confronted, elicits a very clear emotional response from me, as well. It sounds rather redundant to say, but it also takes some time for certain forms of media (music, for instance) to properly affect me emotionally; photography is one of the forms that immediately gets to me. The reason, I think, would be the clarity of it. Oftentimes the subject or idea of the photo is right there. If not, then that itself is part of the idea. That straightforwardness gives it a unique quality to me, and while I don’t think other kinds of art lack it, to photography it is vital. It tells you, “Look at this, see these things that are right here with you in the world you live in.” Whether the camera captures a flower or tourist spot or person or fight, these things all coexist with the viewer.
Even when one dominant idea isn’t immediately obvious in the photo, that too tells the viewer that it was a deliberate choice from the photographer. It is easy to take pictures. It takes so much more time and skill to perfect those pictures. This is what I’ve learned, both from casually snapping photos on my phone and attempting a photography class. With the latter, I will say clearly that I struggled. On one major project, I got an F, being so caught up with what the teacher kept demanding over and over that I missed what I wanted to do in the first place. I essentially “gave up” on the final project for it, and took pictures of things within my own home, playing with things like lighting to simply see how personally interesting I could make these scenes. I set up fake bushes and a Godzilla figure to make my guinea pig seem huge in comparison. I dimmed the lights and set up a warm lamp to mimic the sunset as one of my dolls lay in bed. I found a book I had wanted to read and set it up on a table along with a mug I made when I was little. As it turns out, this final project salvaged my grade, and I passed the class very comfortably. To me, photography is more of what I make than of what I take.

<h2>Week 4</h2>

<p>AI slop has been one of the most worrying “advancements” in tech I have seen yet. I’ve seen it compared to the NFT craze, though the bubble for that popped rather quickly, and it was more like a fad in hindsight; AI has been latched onto by just about everybody. It’s harrowing to me. It is now baked into whatever smart tech one uses, there are people who will blindly believe it (and even give you the “yes, but things are so weird it could happen anyway” excuse when its false nature is pointed out, as I have experienced often), and it constantly gets closer and closer to mimicking human life and art, yet something is still off. Always. The skin is too smooth; the hair blends into some sort of strange mush; a strange, almost cloudy filter stains the picture. It should be noted that this is GENERATIVE AI. Not all AI is the same, and energy could be much better spent investing into the AI that assists in things like detecting cancer early than the AI that takes away critical thought and selfhood. With it taking away that ability to think for oneself, it inherently ensnares audiences who struggle in it more (think toddlers and the elderly, for instance), feeding them a mass of nothing that isn’t rooted in the world they live in. To make art is a human effort, and to tell a machine to do it for you isn’t “the art of writing prompts,” as generative AI’s supporters insist. It’s taking away what agency you have to speak for yourself. 
It’s especially horrifying to see how much it pervades daily life. Like mentioned before, it has slowly seeped in everywhere. My phone offers its AI for me to ask questions to. Google pushes it at the very top of its page searches. Social media sites constantly push it, practically begging me to say one thing to its robot. I can’t even begin to imagine the weight of how it would affect someone it’s trapped. There are so many horror stories of “chatbot psychosis” I’ve seen, catalyzed by an AI chatbot that does nothing but agree, agree, agree, with no personality, no humanity of its own, only what it’s trained on. It’s notably different to previous advancements in tech that caused scares. TV, video games, and the Internet have all sparked worry about melting children’s minds, being awful influences. The key difference is that at the heart of these, unlike AI, there is still humanity there. Other humans make the shows and games people interact with, and go on the internet to talk to each other. AI creates a truly isolating effect in comparison. This is not to say the other three are all without flaws, though at least they have the freedom of simply different thoughts and experiences. AI is ever-agreeing. It does not think for itself. It has no lived experiences of a person to go off of, to feel with and not calculate.</p>

<h2>Week 6</h2>
<p>Something I’ve noticed with the way the stories use illustrations compared to photographs is that the former tends to appear first, with the latter showing up gradually over the course of the story and being fully the case by the end. After that, before the brief text explanations at the end, there are video recordings of experts describing the issues shown in the stories. A graphic novel itself is a mix of illustration and writing, and this is being combined with photography and videography, as well as an online interactive setting, to create these stories and to make them as impactful as they are. I hadn’t even noticed the slow introduction of photography into the stories at first, but when I saw them, the weight of how real these stories are sunk in even more.  The photos aren’t always immediately present, and tend to show more and more by the end, for instance; that helps readers have it set in that these stories are painfully real, that everything they’ve read happened to not only the individuals described but so many other women.That addition of full-on realism, showing the places and people described outright beyond depictions of them, makes the importance of the stories told that much more emphasized. The other mediums used add to this even more; the videography gives more insight into how these issues have impacts on a societal level, and how the individual stories described are one of many here. The online interactivity of it makes it more easily accessible to people, as well as letting the reader take in what they’re seeing (with the dialogue gradually appearing rather than immediately.) The writing contributes to the groundedness and serious tone the stories are showing in that it’s very to the point and personal, and, to be honest, it makes me wonder to what extent these anecdotes are directly quoted. It’s very haunting, and in that sense, it gets the reality of these situations across perfectly. All of these combining to make the graphic novel gives it a lot more of that impact and shows the reader exactly what the writers and artists are aiming to show. If this was text-only, for instance, the descriptions of what happened would still be very real and sobering, but it lacks the extra emotional relevance the readers may get from seeing things like faces and full visual depictions. Photography only would do the same, but the text adds a lot of context to these stories that the photos may not be fully able to convey, and the illustrations can essentially simplify the photos into showing clearer emotional effects on the people the story is about (for example, showing more clearly the anguish these women have had with their issues.) Using all of these methods to weave the story together make use of their advantages, while also limiting the disadvantages, and the way in which they’re actually used helps with that, and so I think the use of these 4 mediums and what they’re on (the online platform) is used very, and strikingly, well.</p>
