<h2>Week 2 (Susan Sontag Reflection Piece)</h2>

<p>After reading Sontag’s writing, quite frankly, I feel as though the description of photography as a means to immortalize a moment resonates with me the most clearly. That is primarily what it has been for me my entire life; for one, I’m well aware I struggle with memory, and that it’s difficult for me to recall even major events unless something triggers those memories to resurface. With photos, I can keep those moments as those “triggers,” and be able to look back on everything I’ve done. Something I’ve liked to do for a few years now is to take a selfie on days where I feel like I look nice. It’s helped me see myself age and heal, especially since I suffer from dealing with poor impulses that hurt me physically (such as picking nails, for example.) The growth and passage of time seems to ground me, almost. In that way, I acknowledge that I’m also using photography to lay bare the truth. The truth of myself, at least.
Looking at others’ photos of anything, the mundane or celebrations or terrifying things that have to be confronted, elicits a very clear emotional response from me, as well. It sounds rather redundant to say, but it also takes some time for certain forms of media (music, for instance) to properly affect me emotionally; photography is one of the forms that immediately gets to me. The reason, I think, would be the clarity of it. Oftentimes the subject or idea of the photo is right there. If not, then that itself is part of the idea. That straightforwardness gives it a unique quality to me, and while I don’t think other kinds of art lack it, to photography it is vital. It tells you, “Look at this, see these things that are right here with you in the world you live in.” Whether the camera captures a flower or tourist spot or person or fight, these things all coexist with the viewer.
Even when one dominant idea isn’t immediately obvious in the photo, that too tells the viewer that it was a deliberate choice from the photographer. It is easy to take pictures. It takes so much more time and skill to perfect those pictures. This is what I’ve learned, both from casually snapping photos on my phone and attempting a photography class. With the latter, I will say clearly that I struggled. On one major project, I got an F, being so caught up with what the teacher kept demanding over and over that I missed what I wanted to do in the first place. I essentially “gave up” on the final project for it, and took pictures of things within my own home, playing with things like lighting to simply see how personally interesting I could make these scenes. I set up fake bushes and a Godzilla figure to make my guinea pig seem huge in comparison. I dimmed the lights and set up a warm lamp to mimic the sunset as one of my dolls lay in bed. I found a book I had wanted to read and set it up on a table along with a mug I made when I was little. As it turns out, this final project salvaged my grade, and I passed the class very comfortably. To me, photography is more of what I make than of what I take.
