<p>I feel like this was one of the easier homework assignments for me, since it is essentially creating something out of nothing. That's what I'm better at, rather than having somewhere to start with. I suppose it just gives me more freedom. I am still really unfamiliar with Illustrator, though, so I wanted to keep it fairly simple and stylized; plus, I decided to play to my strengths with this, most notably that I'm much more comfortable creating rounder than sharper shapes with Illustrator so far. I might branch out and experiment more in the future, but for now, as a first attempt, I'm satisfied. I used softer tones of yellow and blue to contribute to the emotion I was trying to show with the eye (sad), and decided I could spice things up a bit by making the background of the eye be a gradient from yellow to blue, so that it gradually transitions into the tear. I found it a lot easier to make the whole thing one shape, and it ended up being more visually appealing too, I would think. My one major issue actually came with uploading it, since I couldn't get Illustrator to crop the image. I have no idea why it's so difficult with Illustrator specifically, but I suppose that's something I'll have to learn when using it in the future. Otherwise, I think I'm starting to get the hang of it. I think I've heard that we're supposed to animate our eyes soon, and THAT is what scares me rather than just creating it.</p>
