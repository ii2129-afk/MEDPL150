<p>This assignment stressed me out to no end. It really, really did. Firstly, I have to point out that THERE ARE MULTIPLE ENDINGS!!! THERE ARE 4!!! I did not add multiple ways to get the fourth one because I would like for that to be the "proper" end to the story, in a sense, but I fulfilled the general requirement of having at least 3 endings with at least 3 different ways to achieve each ending. I still didn't quite get CSS and the given tutorials didn't help, so I had to figure it out myself; I personally do not feel comfortable using generative AI, so I drew my own images instead, which I admit made the assignment more time-consuming; on top of all that, it was just really tedious to have to type the same things out over and over, even if it was copying and pasting. I think it's okay, but I'm also rather disappointed in myself, since I feel like if I had more time to focus on it, I may have liked the end result more. Another major factor in the difficulty of this was the fact that I had finals and final projects almost stacked on one another, so I could only dedicate the days after classes actually ended to working on it. I am proud that I have done it at all,  but I would prefer to not look at it again myself. I am at least proud of having learned to do different things through simply trying, like centering an image or changing the background color, with CSS. I found a website with tutorials that helped me with CSS in particular, and I got the hang of it rather quickly, but it was still very intimidating to try. Seeing actual examples of CSS put in helped me, too. I am too tired to have any other thoughts about the website, really. It exists, and I'm at least content with that.</p>
