<h1>Isabella Irizarry</h1>

<p>Isabella Irizarry is an aspiring multimedia artist who focuses on 2D art. She has also experimented with music, and hopes to learn more about filmmaking and creating interactive media. She also has light experience with photography and sculpture, and intends to pick up the latter again in the future; alongside that, she has a fondness for more interactive media, such as video games and themed websites. Seeing artists compete in reality shows such as Face Off served as inspiration for Isabella to begin trying different forms of art and engaging with media she finds the most visually interesting. In particular, practical effects and prosthetic makeup appeal to her, and she may begin to research them more in the future.
Her work focuses on self-discovery above all else, using arts as a means to learn more about her selfhood, desires, and thought process. New and inconsistent techniques and pushing limits to understand what she likes are her ultimate goals in her art. She began to draw from an early age, being self-taught until high school, and enjoys sketching as a hobby; animals are a favorite subject for her to draw, especially her pet guinea pigs, her constant source of motivation. Isabella also hopes to engage with themes of mental health and illness in her future works, stemming from her own struggles with anxiety and depression, and push to one day find proper help. Until then, she would like to use her work to reach out to others, herself most of all.
