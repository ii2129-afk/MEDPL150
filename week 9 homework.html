  <p>This assignment frustrated me a lot, honestly. For one, I am still struggling with Illustrator cropping, and so I had to resize it through Github. There is a bit of a resolution loss for that reason, but I would rather it be complete and readable as a main priority. In addition, I had to wait for the poll to run across the course of 3 days, so I had nearly forgotten about it until I received the notification that the poll had finished. From there, my main issue was wanting to figure out how to depict the percentages; to save time and for easier readability, I put the percentages on both the actual slices of the pie chart, and a key below it. I figured a pie chart would be best for this type of data, since they are percentages making up a whole, and since I had asked only one question, it is easier to show it with this, and be able to focus on it. Admittedly, I was also not very interested in data visualization, and so this assignment was slightly harder to focus on and complete as a result. I feel as though I have made something readable, at least, because of the contrast in colors I used between the bluer tones of the pie chart and the warmer, more beige tones of the background. It looked too boring when I had technically finished inputting the data, since the plain background was simply... there. Because of that, I found an image relevant to the data (since it was asking how people spend their free time, I found an image of people walking in a plaza) and put it at a low opacity over the plain beige background. That added more visual appeal to it, while still making it readable.</p>
